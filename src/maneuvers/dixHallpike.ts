/**
 * Dix-Hallpike test, expressed as HeadFrame waypoint quaternions, parametrized by which
 * ear is being tested. HeadFrame: +X anterior, +Y left, +Z superior. World frame
 * coincides with head-neutral (seated, facing forward) at t=0.
 *
 * Waypoint angles (45 deg neck turn, ~20 deg extension below horizontal) are common
 * clinical-teaching approximations, not patient-specific or universally standardized
 * numbers -- treated as tunable, not authoritative.
 *
 * Built from a single parametrized function rather than two hand-mirrored files: the
 * only side-dependent quantity is the sign of the yaw (turn) rotation.
