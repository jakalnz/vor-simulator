 * and applies them as three separate, ordered rotations: torsion always spins the eye
 * about the camera-facing line-of-sight axis (through the pupil), independent of gaze
 * direction, then the gaze deflection (vertical/horizontal) points that already-torsed
 * eye up/down/left/right. A single combined rotation about the tilted canal-normal axis

 * fixed frontal view can't distinguish "spinning about a tilted axis" from "nodding" at
 * a glance) -- decoupling torsion onto its own fixed screen-facing axis keeps it legible
 * as a clean clockwise/counterclockwise spin no matter how much vertical/horizontal
 * component is mixed in, matching how clinicians actually read torsional nystagmus (as
 * rotation of the iris pattern around the pupil, not tilt of the whole eye).
 *
 * Builds a procedural eyeball (radial iris spokes + a full ring of limbus ticks, needed
 * because a plain solid-colored iris/pupil rotated about its own center looks identical
 * at any angle) but keeps it hidden by default -- the realistic model (real photographic
 * iris) is what users are meant to see, and is loaded in immediately. The procedural
